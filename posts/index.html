    Conditionals (if, switch, and match statements) are usually the first tool programmers reach for when we need to vary the execution of a function. They&rsquo;re easy to understand and convenient to use, as long as the variations are simple. As software grows, though, extensibility and comprehensibility begin to require that we create ways to &ldquo;hook&rdquo; new functionality into our functions. The strategy pattern offers a method to accomplish that:
 Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.

    Chances are, you know what Bitcoin is. After all, it&rsquo;s valued at over $47,000 per Bitcoin right now. This post isn&rsquo;t about the business side of things, though, or the BTC speculative bubble. I want to explain how it works.1
Foundations: Hashes and Ledgers First, a hash algorithm is a way to convert a given string into an unpredictable string of a fixed length, called a digest.

    You encounter a crusty old-timer who tells you how great programming used to be: the computer just did what you told it. Languages were simple and easy to understand. In awe, you ask: &ldquo;Did you write FORTRAN? or assembly?&rdquo; The old-timer laughs: he&rsquo;s not that old. He started with C!
It&rsquo;s common to think of C and other &ldquo;old&rdquo; languages as being &ldquo;close to the machine,&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s because the Unix abstractions have become so ubiquitous that we no longer think of them as abstractions.

    When I began learning Haskell, typeclasses were confusing to me: at first, because I didn&rsquo;t fully understand why they were needed, and later, because I didn&rsquo;t understand the advantages they offered over Java&rsquo;s interfaces. If you&rsquo;re new to Rust but haven&rsquo;t used Haskell before, you&rsquo;ll likely be in the same boat, but moreso; traits are pervasive in the ecosystem.
At heart, traits are very similar to interfaces in Java or Câ™¯.

    I recently had a conversation with a friend who said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust most of what I hear about Rust, because it sounds like agitprop from the Rust Evangelism Strike Force, but people like you whom I trust and respect seem to like it. Can you help me understand why?&rdquo;
I tried to. I said things that make sense, in the abstract: it offers a very powerful type system, it allows me to feel more confident about my code in surprising ways, and so on.

    I don&rsquo;t like docopt. That makes me an outlier; most people I&rsquo;ve talked to seem to think it makes command-line applications &ldquo;easy.&rdquo; They like its premise that, by writing documentation, you&rsquo;re writing code. When you make a command-line application with docopt, you&rsquo;ve automatically got the help text written and the module documented properly, right? Why bother with something verbose and object-oriented like argparse?
My objection is that you aren&rsquo;t writing code, but you&rsquo;re also not writing documentation, despite the name of the package.

    Recursion was a concept that took me a long time to understand. It wasn&rsquo;t until years after I&rsquo;d started programming that I felt I really understood it, and it wasn&rsquo;t until years after that that I felt confident reaching for it as a tool. Like almost everyone, the first way that I learned to think of iteration was with loops. If you wanted to add something together, for example, you would create a &ldquo;bookkeeping&rdquo; variable and modify it inside the loop.

    In addition to [the monad] being useful, it is also cursed and the curse of the monad is that once you get the epiphany, once you understand&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s what it is!&quot;&mdash;you lose the ability to explain it to anybody. &mdash; Doug Crockford.
 I had a problem, once. I was working on a Rails application which generated integration files to be consumed by external partners. They were generated every night in a dozen formats and shipped around the Internet to populate sites you&rsquo;ve probably used.

    &ldquo;If you truly accumulate effort for a long time, then you will advance.&rdquo; Xunzi.
 It&rsquo;s no secret that many programmers are self-taught. Some of us, myself included, lack formal credentials related to computer science. I&rsquo;ve worked with good programmers who didn&rsquo;t graduate high school. It&rsquo;s a strange profession, with the skills often acquired simply as a side effect of tinkering. You don&rsquo;t hear about many civil engineers or corporate attorneys who do what they do because they enjoyed playing Zork on their dad&rsquo;s office computer.

    I went to public school in the United States, and I was always &ldquo;bad at math.&rdquo; I hated homework and tests, and it never got better: as I went through the grades, the problems got longer and more intricate, and I inevitably would make a calculation error&mdash;misplacing a decimal or flubbing an easy sum&mdash;halfway through. I got used to seeing $\color{red}{-\frac{1}{2}}$ on my papers. Those add up!
In college, the first thing I did when planning my path through general education was look for a way to avoid Calculus.

    There are a few tendencies among programmers that involve the totem of &ldquo;simplicity.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s the ancient concept of KISS, of course, but there&rsquo;s also the much-abused YAGNI, the insistence that we &ldquo;Choose Boring Technology,&quot; entire languages that base their elevator pitch around the idea that they&rsquo;re &ldquo;simple,&rdquo; and the concept in object-oriented design that &ldquo;every class should have a single responsibility.&rdquo;
The problem with these approaches is that &ldquo;simplicity&rdquo; never gets a rigorous definition.

    <p>I recently read <a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/">&ldquo;Parse, Don&rsquo;t Validate,&rdquo;
</a> shared it with my
coworkers, and let it <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/uemphs/parse_don_t_validate">bring me out of
retirement</a> on
<a href="https://lobste.rs/">lobste.rs</a>. It captures a concept that I&rsquo;ve struggled to explain,
leading to cases where I couldn&rsquo;t say why I thought something was better beyond a vague
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter of taste.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not very satisfactory as a justification when you&rsquo;re
trying to explain to someone why they should rework a piece of code in a review.</p>
