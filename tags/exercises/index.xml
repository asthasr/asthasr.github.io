      <description>Recursion was a concept that took me a long time to understand. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until years after I&amp;rsquo;d started programming that I felt I really understood it, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until years after that that I felt confident reaching for it as a tool. Like almost everyone, the first way that I learned to think of iteration was with loops. If you wanted to add something together, for example, you would create a &amp;ldquo;bookkeeping&amp;rdquo; variable and modify it inside the loop.</description>
