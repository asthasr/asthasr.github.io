      <description>In addition to it begin useful, it is also cursed and the curse of the monad is that once you get the epiphany, once you understand&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s what it is!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;you lose the ability to explain it to anybody. &amp;mdash; Doug Crockford.
 I had a problem, once. I was working on a Rails application which generated integration files to be consumed by external partners. They were generated every night in a dozen formats and shipped around the Internet to populate sites you&amp;rsquo;ve probably used.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;If you truly accumulate effort for a long time, then you will advance.&amp;rdquo; Xunzi.
 It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that many programmers are self-taught. Some of us, myself included, lack formal credentials related to computer science. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with good programmers who didn&amp;rsquo;t graduate high school. It&amp;rsquo;s a strange profession, with the skills often acquired simply as a side effect of tinkering. You don&amp;rsquo;t hear about many civil engineers or corporate attorneys who do what they do because they enjoyed playing Zork on their dad&amp;rsquo;s office computer.</description>

      <title>On Symbolic Logic</title>

      <description>I went to public school in the United States, and I was always &amp;ldquo;bad at math.&amp;rdquo; I hated homework and tests, and it never got better: as I went through the grades, the problems got longer and more intricate, and I inevitably would make a calculation error&amp;mdash;misplacing a decimal or flubbing an easy sum&amp;mdash;halfway through. I got used to seeing $\color{red}{-\frac{1}{2}}$ on my papers. Those add up!
In college, the first thing I did when planning my path through general education was look for a way to avoid Calculus.</description>

      <title>&#34;Parsing&#34; in Python</title>
      <link>https://asthasr.github.io/posts/parsing-in-python/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently read &lt;a href=&#34;https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Parse, Don&amp;rsquo;t Validate&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/a&gt;
and liked it enough to share it with my coworkers and let it &lt;a href=&#34;https://lobste.rs/s/uemphs/parse_don_t_validate&#34;&gt;bring me out of
retirement&lt;/a&gt; on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://lobste.rs/&#34;&gt;lobste.rs&lt;/a&gt;. It captures a concept that I have struggled to
explain, leading to many cases where I couldn&amp;rsquo;t say why I thought something was
better beyond a vague &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a matter of taste.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s not very satisfactory as
a justification when you&amp;rsquo;re trying to explain to someone why they should rework
a piece of code in a review.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
